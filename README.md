# Hidden Search Widget Project

This project uses JavaScript and CSS transitions to display a search icon; when the icon is clicked, the search bar widens for typing.

## Objective
* Use JavaScript event handlers to activate a transition that widens the search bar when the search icon button is clicked.
* Use CSS transitions and transform: translateX on the button so that it moves with the search bar after clicking.
